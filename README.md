# 🕵️ Stalk - Social Tracking & Auto-Link Kit

*The GitHub following tool that does what we're all thinking but too polite to say.*

Stop pretending you're not already stalking people's GitHub profiles. **Stalk** just automates the awkward part.

A Node.js script that automatically manages mutual following relationships on GitHub using the GitHub API, with advanced recursive following capabilities that would make even the most dedicated social media stalker jealous.

## 🎯 What Stalk Does (Because We're Being Honest Here)

**Stalk** creates perfect mutual following relationships by doing the digital equivalent of sliding into DMs, but for GitHub:

### Standard Stalking Mode 👀
- **Following Back**: Automatically follows users who follow you but you don't follow back *(basic courtesy stalking)*
- **Unfollowing Non-Followers**: Unfollows users you follow who don't follow you back *(dignity preservation)*

### Ambitious Stalking Mode 🚀
*For when you want to take your GitHub social game to the next level:*

1. **Depth-First Stalking**: Starting from a target user, follows their followers
2. **Recursive Stalking**: Then follows the followers of those followers, and so on
3. **Smart Stalking Limits**: Configurable depth and per-user limits to prevent API exhaustion
4. **Anti-Stalking-Loop Protection**: Tracks processed users to avoid infinite stalking cycles

*Because manually following people is so 2020.*

 ## ⚙️ Stalking Operations Control
 
 You can fine-tune Stalk’s behavior with vriend and flexible operational flags:
 
 -   `--help` or `-h`: Shows the help message with all available commands and options.
 -   `--follow-only`: Restricts the script to only follow back users who follow you, skipping the unfollow process entirely.
 -   `--unfollow-only`: Limits the script to only unfollow users who do not follow you back, without following anyone.
 -   `--export`: Saves the results of a `--dry-run` to a plain text file, allowing you to review the list of users to be followed or unfollowed before executing any action.
 
 ## 🎮 Usage (Time to Stalk!)
 
 ### Standard Mutual Following Stalking

#### Dry Run (Recommended for Stalking Beginners)
Preview what Stalk would do without actually following/unfollowing anyone:
```bash
npm run dry-run
```

#### Live Stalking Mode
Execute the mutual follow management:
```bash
npm start
```

#### Fine-Grained Control
Stalk allows for more specific actions. If you only want to follow back users who already follow you, you can use the `--follow-only` flag. This is useful for ensuring you reciprocate all follows without altering your existing following list.
```bash
npm run dry-run:follow          # Preview who you will follow back
npm run follow                  # Execute the follow-back process
```
Conversely, if you prefer to only unfollow users who don't follow you back, the `--unfollow-only` flag lets you clean up your following list without following anyone new.
```bash
npm run dry-run:unfollow        # Preview who you will unfollow
npm run unfollow                # Execute the unfollowing process
```

#### Exporting Results
For those who prefer to analyze stalking results offline, Stalk provides an export feature. When used with `--dry-run`, you can save the list of users to be followed or unfollowed to a text file. This is perfect for keeping records or for use in other scripts.
```bash
npm run export:follow           # Export list of users to follow to follow.txt
npm run export:unfollow         # Export list of users to unfollow to unfollow.txt
npm run export                  # Export both lists to results.txt
```

### Ambitious Recursive Stalking 🚀
*For advanced stalkers only*

#### Dry Run Ambitious Stalking
Preview recursive following from a target user:
```bash
node main.js --dry-run --ambitious username
# or
node main.js --dry-run -a username
```

#### Live Ambitious Stalking
Execute recursive following *(use with caution - this is serious stalking)*:
```bash
node main.js --ambitious username
# or
node main.js -a username
```

#### Combined Stalking Mode
Run both mutual follow management AND ambitious recursive stalking:
```bash
node main.js --ambitious username  # Maximum stalking efficiency
```

## 🧠 How Stalk Works (The Stalking Algorithm)

### Standard Stalking Mode
1. **Authentication**: Connects to GitHub API using your stalking credentials
2. **Intelligence Gathering**: Fetches your complete following and followers lists
3. **Relationship Analysis**: Identifies mutual vs non-mutual relationships
4. **Strategic Following**: Follows users who follow you but you don't follow back
5. **Dignity Cleanup**: Unfollows users you follow who don't follow you back

### Ambitious Stalking Mode
1. **Standard Operations**: First completes mutual follow management
2. **Target Analysis**: Fetches followers of the specified target user
3. **Depth-First Stalking Traversal**: For each follower:
   - Follows the user (if not already following)
   - Recursively processes their followers *(stalking their network)*
   - Continues up to maximum depth (default: 3 levels of stalking)
4. **Smart Stalking Limiting**: 
   - Maximum 50 followers processed per user (configurable)
   - Cycle detection prevents infinite stalking loops
   - Rate limiting prevents API exhaustion

## 🛡️ Safety Features (Responsible Stalking)

- **Dry Run Mode**: Test your stalking strategy without making any changes
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects GitHub API limits with intelligent delays
- **Cycle Detection**: Prevents infinite stalking loops
- **Depth Limiting**: Maximum stalking recursion depth (default: 3 levels)
- **Per-User Limits**: Maximum followers processed per user (default: 50)
- **Error Handling**: Continues stalking even if individual requests fail
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows detailed stalking progress and final statistics
- **Confirmation Delays**: Countdown before starting stalking operations

## ⚙️ Configuration (Stalking Parameters)

You can modify these stalking limits in the code:

```javascript
this.maxDepth = 3;           // Maximum stalking recursion depth
this.maxFollowsPerUser = 50; // Maximum followers per stalking target
```

## 🔑 Token Permissions (Your Stalking License)

Your GitHub token needs the `user:follow` scope to:
- Read your following/followers lists *(basic stalking intel)*
- Read other users' followers lists *(advanced stalking intel)*
- Follow and unfollow users *(execute stalking operations)*

## ⏱️ Rate Limits (Stalking Responsibly)

- GitHub API allows 5,000 requests per hour for authenticated requests
- Standard stalking mode: 1-second delays between operations
- Ambitious stalking mode: 1.5-second delays between operations
- Can safely process ~2,400 stalking operations per hour in ambitious mode

## 🔒 Security Notes (Stalking Ethics)

- Keep your `.env` file private and never commit it to version control
- The token only needs `user:follow` scope - don't grant unnecessary stalking permissions
- You can revoke the token anytime from GitHub settings
- **Use ambitious stalking mode carefully** - it can follow many users quickly
- Remember: With great stalking power comes great stalking responsibility

## 🤔 Why Use Stalk?

- **Clean Following Lists**: Maintain organized, mutual relationships
- **Strategic Network Growth**: Intelligently expand your GitHub network
- **Social Reciprocity**: Ensure you follow back your followers
- **Account Management**: Keep your GitHub social connections tidy
- **Time Saving**: Automate tedious manual follow/unfollow tasks
- **Safe Operation**: Dry-run mode prevents accidental stalking mistakes
- **Smart Growth**: Recursive following helps discover relevant users
- **Honest Branding**: We call it what it is - no pretense here

## 🐛 Troubleshooting (When Stalking Goes Wrong)

**"GitHub token is required" error:**
- Make sure you copied `.env.example` to `.env`
- Verify your stalking token is correctly set in the `.env` file

**"Failed to authenticate" error:**
- Check that your stalking token is valid and not expired
- Ensure the token has `user:follow` scope

**"Ambitious stalking mode requires a target username" error:**
- Make sure to provide a username: `--ambitious username`
- Check that the target username exists and is public

**"Cannot use --follow-only and --unfollow-only flags simultaneously" error:**
- These flags are mutually exclusive. Choose one or the other.

**"Export functionality is only available in dry run mode" error:**
- Add the `--dry-run` flag to your command to export the results.

**Rate limiting errors:**
- Stalk handles this automatically with delays
- If you hit limits, wait an hour and try again
- Consider reducing `maxFollowsPerUser` for large stalking operations

**"Perfect! You have mutual following with everyone" message:**
- This means your account already has mutual relationships
- No changes are needed for standard stalking mode
- Ambitious stalking mode will still run if specified

**⚠️ Important**: Ambitious stalking mode can follow many users quickly. Always test with `--dry-run` first and use responsibly to avoid appearing as spam to other users. Remember: We're all stalking, but let's be classy about it.

**🕵️ Disclaimer**: Stalk is a legitimate GitHub automation tool. The "stalking" terminology is used humorously to acknowledge what we're all actually doing when we browse GitHub profiles and follow interesting developers. Use responsibly and respect others' privacy and GitHub's terms of service.
